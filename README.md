# Remarket_SE2
After a long descussion, here is our planning

## Technology:
# Frontend: HTML, CSS,React
# Backend: C#
We will use and SQL database to store all the necessary data. The database design will be stored as a .sql file containing the commands for creating the database. The example data will be stored in the same way. We will use C# for handling the http requests.

## Conventions:
gitflow
Scrum
All the commits shall be named according to the gitflow 
convention:

<<<<<<< HEAD
We will use two main branches: main and develop and personal branches. No commits to the main or develop branch should be made. When working on more complex parts of the project everyone is encouraged to create additional branches and then merge them back into their personal branch. Pull requests to the main branch will happen after finishing a specific stage/ feature of the project, they shall not be made daily. Pull requests from the personal branches shall be madefrequently. 
=======
    feat: Introducing new features or significant improvements.
    fix: Bug fixes that resolve issues in your code.
    docs: Updates or additions to documentation.
    style: Cosmetic changes that don't affect code functionality (like formatting).
    refactor: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature but improve structure.
    test: Everything about testing - adding or fixing tests.
    chore: Routine tasks or updates to the build process.
    perf: Enhancements that improve performance.
    ci: Modifications related to CI/CD processes.
    build: Changes affecting the build system or external dependencies.
    revert: Undoing previous changes.

The commit message should consist of the category and, after a comma, the explanation.
