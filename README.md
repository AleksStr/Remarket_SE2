# Remarket_SE2
After a long descussion, here is our planning

## Technology:
# Frontend: HTML, CSS,React
# Backend: C#
We will use and SQL database to store all the necessary data. The database design will be stored as a .sql file containing the commands for creating the database. The example data will be stored in the same way. We will use C# for handling the http requests.

## Conventions:
gitflow
Scrum

We will use two main branches: main and develop and feature branches. No commits to the main branch should be made. When working on more complex parts of the project everyone is encouraged to create additional feature branches and then merge them back into the develop branch. Pull requests to the main branch will happen after finishing a specific stage/ feature of the project, they shall not be made daily.
